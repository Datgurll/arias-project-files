### **Assemble Your C++ Projects with Ease Using Custom Scaffolding**

When you're itching to start a new C++ project, the last thing you want to do is get bogged down with the same old setup chores. Imagine jumping straight to the fun part—coding! That’s where custom scaffolding comes into play, streamlining your project setup so that everything from your favorite libraries to the essential `CMakeLists.txt` is ready to roll.

#### **Why Should You Use Custom Scaffolding?**

Custom scaffolding is like having a personal assistant for your coding projects. It sets up your project environment just how you like it, with all the directories and dependencies in place. This means you can dive into the coding pool headfirst, without the setup hassle.

#### **What You'll Need**

Before we get rolling, make sure you have:
- A C++ compiler that’s ready to go.
- CMake, because nobody likes to juggle build processes manually.
- Git, to keep your versions under control.

#### **How to Build Your Custom Scaffolding**

Let's get down to business. Here’s how to whip up a scaffolding tool that’ll have your C++ projects up and running in no time:

**Step 1: Map Out Your Project Structure**

Think about how you like your projects organized. A place for your source code, headers, tests, and build artifacts should do the trick.

**Step 2: Craft a Configuration File**

Whip up a JSON file that lays out the essentials like your project's name and any dependencies. Here’s a simple example:

```json
{
  "projectName": "AwesomeCppProject",
  "dependencies": []
}
```

**Step 3: Automate with a Bash Script**

Now, let’s automate the setup with a bash script that builds your project structure, kicks off a git repo, and crafts a `CMakeLists.txt`. Here’s a script tailored just for this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Error out on issues
function display_error {
    echo >&2 "Oops! $1"
    exit 1
}

# Ensure prerequisites are met
if ! command -v cmake &>/dev/null || ! command -v git &>/dev/null; then
    display_error "We need CMake and git, but they're MIA. Please install and try again."
fi

# Load your config
config=$(<config.json)
if [ -z "$config" ]; then
    display_error "Hold up, your 'config.json' is like a ghost town. Please check and retry."
fi

# Get the project rolling
projectName=$(jq -r '.projectName' <<< "$config")
if [ -z "$projectName" ]; then
    display_error "We need a 'projectName' in your config. Please add it and re-run."
fi

# Set up the directories
mkdir -p "$projectName"/{src,include,tests,build}

# Cook up a CMakeLists.txt
cat <<EOF > "$projectName"/CMakeLists.txt
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(${projectName})

set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11)

# Add source and header files
file(GLOB SOURCES "src/*.cpp")
file(GLOB HEADERS "include/*.h")

# Let's make an executable
add_executable(${projectName} \${SOURCES} \${HEADERS})
EOF

# Git-ify your project
git init "$projectName"
git -C "$projectName" add .
git -C "$projectName" commit -m "Initial scaffolding commit"

# And you're done!
echo "Your project '$projectName' is ready to rock! Dive into the 'src/' directory and start coding. Build it up with CMake."
```

#### **Wrap-Up**

With custom scaffolding, you’re not just starting a C++ project; you’re launching into coding with zero delays. Set up your scaffolding once, and save loads of time on every new project. Why wait? Set up your custom scaffolding and make your C++ development smoother than ever!
